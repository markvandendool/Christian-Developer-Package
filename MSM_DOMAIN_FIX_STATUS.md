# MSM Domain Fix Implementation Status

## VERSION: 0.0.2

## COMPLETED STEPS:
✅ **Step 1: Domain Configuration Fixed**
   - Updated vercel.json: "millionsongmind.com" → "millionsonmind.com" 
   - Now matches ChordCubes working domain (no bot protection)

✅ **Step 2: Version Incremented**
   - package.json: "0.0.0" → "0.0.2" (following 0.1 increment rule)

## CURRENT STATUS:
⚠️ **MSM Build Configuration**
   - Vite config has `base: '/MSM/'` path configured
   - Local test at localhost:8006 shows 404s for /MSM/ assets
   - Need rebuild with corrected configuration

## NEXT REQUIRED ACTIONS:

### STEP 3: Rebuild MSM Application 
```bash
cd /Users/markvandendool/Christian-Developer-Package/apps/million-song-mind
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

### STEP 4: Test Corrected Build
```bash
cd dist
python3 -m http.server 8007
# Test: http://localhost:8007/
# Verify: Assets load from correct paths (no /MSM/ 404s)
```

### STEP 5: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy to millionsonmind.com/MSM/ (same project as ChordCubes)
# This should bypass Vercel Security Checkpoint
```

### STEP 6: Verify Production Access
- Test: https://millionsonmind.com/MSM/
- Expected: Working MSM application (no security blocks)
- Compare: Same access level as https://millionsonmind.com/cubes/

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
**Root Cause:** MSM was deploying under protected Vercel project due to domain mismatch
**Solution:** Deploy under same project as ChordCubes (millionsonmind.com)
**Expected Result:** MSM accessible without bot protection

## VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Local test shows no 404s 
- [ ] Assets load correctly from base path
- [ ] Production deployment accessible
- [ ] No Vercel Security Checkpoint
