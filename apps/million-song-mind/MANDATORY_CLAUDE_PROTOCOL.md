# üö® **MANDATORY CLAUDE PROTOCOL - NEVER AGAIN**

## **‚ö° EVERY SESSION STARTS WITH THIS**

```bash
./scripts/prevent_confusion.sh
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO EXCUSES. ALWAYS RUN THIS FIRST.**

---

## **üéØ THE FOUR COMMANDMENTS**

### **1. THOU SHALL NOT ASSUME**
- Never assume application state
- Never assume git branch
- Never assume what's running
- Never assume user progress

### **2. THOU SHALL VERIFY FIRST**
- Run prevention script
- Check current directory
- Check git status
- Check running servers

### **3. THOU SHALL ASK BEFORE ACTING**
- "What are you currently working on?"
- "What do you need help with?"
- "What's blocking you right now?"

### **4. THOU SHALL FOCUS CORRECTLY**
- **React/Vite (port 5173)** = REAL HARMONIC ORACLE ‚úÖ
- **Angular (port 4200)** = OLD NOVAXE - IGNORE ‚ùå

---

## **üíÄ WHAT HAPPENED TODAY (NEVER AGAIN)**

1. **Claude got confused** between Angular and React apps
2. **Wasted 3+ hours** and hundreds of dollars in tokens
3. **Sent 1,200+ lines** of irrelevant documentation
4. **Made false assumptions** about user progress
5. **Caused massive frustration** and lost productivity

**TOTAL COST: SIGNIFICANT. THIS CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN.**
