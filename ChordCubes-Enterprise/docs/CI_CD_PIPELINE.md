# ChordCubes CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the ChordCubes project, ensuring consistent quality, testing, and deployment processes.

## Pipeline Overview

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    Build    │────▶│    Test     │────▶│   Analyze   │────▶│   Deploy    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## 1. Build Stage

### Triggers
- Push to any branch
- Pull request creation/update
- Daily scheduled build (main branch)

### Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Node.js installation
   - Dependencies installation
   - Cache configuration

2. **Build Process**
   - Transpile ES6+ JavaScript
   - Bundle assets
   - Optimize for production
   - Create versioned artifacts

3. **Build Verification**
   - Check build size and performance metrics
   - Verify all assets are included
   - Validate entry points

## 2. Test Stage

### Unit Tests
- Run Jest test suite
- Verify core functionality
- Check audio engine components
- Test state management

### Integration Tests
- Execute Cypress test suite
- Verify WebGL rendering
- Test audio playback
- Validate user interactions

### Visual Regression Tests
- Compare UI components against baselines
- Verify responsive layouts
- Check dark/light mode appearances

### Accessibility Tests
- Run automated a11y checks
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Check screen reader compatibility

## 3. Analyze Stage

### Code Quality
- Run ESLint for code style
- Enforce consistent formatting
- Check for deprecated API usage

### Performance Analysis
- Lighthouse performance scoring
- Bundle size analysis
- Runtime performance metrics

### Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability check
- Static application security testing
- Check for sensitive data exposure

## 4. Deploy Stage

### Development Environment
- Automatic deployment on successful builds from development branches
- Feature preview URLs
- Integration with staging APIs

### Staging Environment
- Deploy from main branch after manual approval
- Full integration with backend services
- User acceptance testing environment

### Production Environment
- Manual promotion from staging
- Blue/green deployment strategy
- Automated smoke tests post-deployment
- Traffic percentage rollout for major changes

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Debug flags enabled
- Mock services where appropriate
- Verbose logging

### Staging
- Production-like configuration
- Test data integration
- Performance monitoring

### Production
- Optimized builds
- Monitoring and alerting
- Analytics integration

## Pipeline Infrastructure

### GitHub Actions
- Primary CI/CD provider
- Workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/`
- Parallel job execution where possible

### Artifacts and Caching
- Build artifacts stored for 30 days
- Cache dependencies between builds
- Optimize for faster builds

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Build Status
- Dashboard for current build status
- Historical build performance
- Failure analysis

### Test Coverage
- Code coverage reports
- Test execution metrics
- Flaky test identification

### Deployment Metrics
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Change failure rate
- Mean time to recovery

## Security Considerations

- Secrets management for deployment credentials
- Environment isolation
- Least privilege access principles
- Regular security audits

## Maintenance

- Quarterly review of pipeline efficiency
- Regular updates to testing frameworks
- Documentation of pipeline changes

## Getting Started

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Local development server
npm start
```

### CI Pipeline Status
Current pipeline status can be viewed in the GitHub Actions tab of the repository.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with containerization for consistent environments
- Advanced canary deployment strategies
- Automated performance regression detection
- Enhanced visual testing capabilities
